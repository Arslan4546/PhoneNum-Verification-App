# Firebase Number Verification App

The primary feature of this app is to verify user phone numbers to ensure a secure and reliable authentication process. Firebase Authentication is utilized to manage the phone number verification, which involves sending a verification code via SMS to the user's phone number. The user then enters this code into the app to complete the verification process.
The application follows best practices in mobile development, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The UI is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, making the phone number verification process straightforward for users. Flutter's cross-platform capabilities ensure that the app runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
